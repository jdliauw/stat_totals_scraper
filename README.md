# stat_totals_scraper
This script web scrapes the player statistics table for a given year/years/range of years from basketball-reference.com and stores each year as a csv in a new directory. This should be run from the terminal/command-line.

As this is my first Git project, this is more of a Git, VIM, and Python web-scraping exercise than a practical or useful tool, as the csv is already provided directly from basketball-reference.com for free.
