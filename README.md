# stat_totals_scraper
This script web scrapes and stores the player statistics table from basketball-reference.com based on the user-input year/s as a csv. 

This should be run from the terminal/command-line. A single year, multiple years, or a range of years are valid inputs. csvs are stored in a directory.

As this is my first personal Git project, this is more of a Git, VIM, and Python web-scraping exercise than a practical or useful tool, as the ycsv is already provided directly from basketball-reference.com.
