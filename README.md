# stat_totals_scraper
This script web scrapes and stores the player statistics table from basketball-reference.com based on the user-input year.

As this is my first personal Git project, this is more of a Git, VIM, 
and Python web-scraping exercise than a practical or useful tool, as the 
csv is already provided directly from basketball-reference.com.
